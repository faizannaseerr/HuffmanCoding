# Huffman Encoding & Decoding üîêüíª

Created a program that uses Huffman coding (greedy) to compress text and share in a lossless manner. A user can input a text message, and the message will be encoded using Huffman encoding, and can be decoded back as well.

## Process

- Had read about lossless compression online, and wanted to implement the Huffman Encoding algorithm individually after understanding its rudimentary idea
- Read into what heaps are (max & min), a data structure I had not covered before
- Implemented a function to create max heaps required for Huffman encoding
- Implemented functions to encode and decode text messages via Huffman enoding & decoding
- Functions rely on concepts, such as recursion and breadth first search (BFS), and data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, heaps, etc.

## Running The Program

File named main.py should be downloaded and then ran as usual for any python program (either through an IDE, or through the terminal/CMD from the same directory as where file is downloaded e.g.

cd downloads
python main.py
